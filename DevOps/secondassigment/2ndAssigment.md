## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Storage Account Creation & Blob Upload

- Created storage account: `mystorageprince`
- Uploaded sample blob (`test.txt`)
- Tested file access via browser & Storage Explorer

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication Methods & Testing

- ‚úÖ Access Keys tested via Azure Storage Explorer
- ‚úÖ SAS Token tested for limited access
- ‚úÖ RBAC tested via user role (Reader)

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Storage Explorer Connection

- Connected using both:
  - **Access Key**
  - **SAS URI**
- Explored Containers, Blobs, and File Shares

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Shared Access Signature (SAS)

- Created SAS with:
  - **Permissions**: rwdlacupiytfx
  - **Services**: Blob, File, Queue, Table
- Shared SAS URI tested on web

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Stored Access Policy over SAS

- Created container-level policy: `readPolicy`
- SAS linked to the stored policy
- Verified policy-scope access

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Access Tiers: Hot / Cool / Archive

- Uploaded file ‚Üí changed tier to:
  - üî• Hot ‚Üí üîÑ Cool ‚Üí üßä Archive
- Documented differences:

| Hot      | High       | Fast       | Active data            |
| Cool     | Medium     | Medium     | Infrequent access      |
| Archive  | Lowest     | Very Slow  | Long-term cold storage |

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Lifecycle Policy Testing

- Created policy:
  - Move blobs from Hot ‚Üí Cool after 7 days
  - Delete after 30 days
- Uploaded blob ‚Üí waited & tested policy

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Geo Replication (RA-GRS/GZRS)

- Enabled **RA-GRS** on `mystorageprince`
- Primary: Central India
- Secondary (read-only): East US
- Accessed blob via replicated read-only endpoint

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ File Share Creation & Mounting

- Created File Share: `myfileshare`
- Uploaded `notes.txt`
- Used connect script:

```powershell
net use Z: \\mystorageprince.file.core.windows.net\myfileshare /u:mystorageprince <your_access_key>
